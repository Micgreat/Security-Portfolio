# Scenario 1: Compromised Workstation Incident
## Objective
Simulate and investigate a workstatio compromise, perform triage, identity indicatios of compromise (IOCs), map to MITRE ATT&CK, and produce a professional incident report 

## Scenario Context
A user reports that their Windows system has slowed down. Unknown processes are consuming resources, and unusual outbound connections to foreign IPs are observed. Youâ€™re the security analyst assigned to investigate.

## Goal
Identify how the compromise occurred, what the attacker did, and how to contain and prevent it.

## Expected

1. Digital forensics (basic)
2. Windows event analysis
3. Log correlation & threat intelligence
4. Incident documentation

## Lab Setup
1. Windows 10/11 VM - Victim workstation
2. Kali Linux VM - Attacker simulation 
3. Security tools VM - Sysmon, ELK, Velociprator, Wireshark
